    "\n",
    "The ATP Matches 2024 dataset contains detailed match-level information for all ATP men’s professional tennis matches played between January 1 and December 31, 2024. The data comes from Jeff Sackmann’s tennis_atp repository and includes 3,076 matches and 49 variables. Each row represents a single tennis match and each column represents one variable, meaning the dataset is already in tidy format.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes several important categories of variables. Tournament information includes surface (Hard, Clay, Grass), tournament level (Grand Slam, Masters 1000, ATP 250/500), and date. Player information includes winner and loser names, handedness, height (cm), and age (years). Match outcome variables include score, round, best_of (3 or 5 sets), and match duration in minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several performance metrics are particularly important:\n",
    "\n",
    "Aces (w_ace, l_ace): Number of serves that result in an immediate point. Measured as a count per match. Professional players typically average 5–15 aces per match. Higher ace counts generally indicate stronger serving performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Double Faults (w_df, l_df): Number of missed second serves. Measured as a count per match. Professionals usually aim to stay under 3–5 per match since double faults directly give points to the opponent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Match Duration (minutes): Measured in minutes. Best-of-three matches typically last 90–150 minutes; best-of-five matches may exceed 3–5 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "ATP Ranking (winner_rank, loser_rank): Numerical ranking (1 = best). Rankings are based on a rolling 52-week point system. Lower numbers indicate stronger players.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset Concerns:\n",
    "\n",
    "Approximately 7% of all values are missing. Missingness is not random. It is strongly associated with incomplete matches (retirements and walkovers). There are 101 matches marked as walkover (W/O) or retirement (RET), and 238 matches missing duration data. Around 60 matches are missing serve statistics such as aces and double faults. These missing values are systematic and expected because incomplete matches do not generate full statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also extreme match duration values (e.g., 0 minutes for walkovers and matches exceeding 220 minutes), but these represent legitimate real-world scenarios and should not automatically be removed."
